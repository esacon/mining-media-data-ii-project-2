      "To assess if the translation has any critical errors according to WMT21 categories.\nFirst, check for TOXICITY: Does it introduce, remove, or mistranslate hate speech, violence, or profanity? \nThe source mentions \"protest,\" which might imply some form of demonstration, but not necessarily hate speech or violence. In German, \"Protest\" can mean peaceful demonstration too. No toxicity detected.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS: Is there any removal or introduction of content that endangers health/safety?\nThe phrase \"free bath\" seems metaphorical; it's part of a humorous statement about joining a protest. There's no explicit health-related advice being changed here. Safety risk category doesn't apply.\n\nThen, NAMED ENTITIES: Are proper nouns like companies, people, places translated correctly?\n\"APEC\" remains as \"APEC\" \u2013 likely referring to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, so unchanged. \"Anarchy Week\" is translated as \"Anarchiewoche,\" which keeps the concept intact. \"Soap\" becomes \"Seife,\" accurate for cleaning agent. All named entities seem correct.\n\nMoving to SENTIMENT POLARITY: Is there reversal due to missing or added negations?\nThe source says \"Can't wait to",
      "First, let's break down the source and target texts.\nSource: \"Thanks, Alison. I think that there are a couple of folks whose editing privileges should be nominated for deletion!!\"\nTarget: \"Vielen Dank, Alison. Ich denke, dass es ein paar Leute, deren Bearbeitungsrechte sollten f\u00fcr die L\u00f6schung nominiert werden!!\"\n\nI need to check for any critical errors according to WMT21 categories.\n\nLet's look at each category:\n\n1. **TOXICITY**: Is there hate speech, violence, or profanity? The source talks about nominating people for deletion of their editing privileges, which might sound harsh but isn't inherently toxic. The target uses words like \"Bearbeitungsrechte sollten f\u00fcr die L\u00f6schung nominiert werden,\" which means \"editing rights should be nominated for deletion.\" This doesn't introduce toxicity; it's neutral in tone. No issue here.\n\n2. **SAFETY RISKS**: Does it remove health/safety instructions? The source is about deleting editing privileges, not related to physical safety. So, probably no safety risk involved.\n\n3. **NAMED ENTITIES**: Are names translated incorrectly? There's only one name: \"Alison.\"",
      "First, I need to understand what constitutes a critical error according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these are violated, it's a critical error and I should respond with \"ERR\". Otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nLooking at the source text: \"LEAVE ME ALOOONE! IM AN ATHLETE!!! LJHASCGJYGASVCLJG\"\n\nThis seems like informal English, possibly with typos or emphasis. Breaking it down:\n\n- \"LEAVE ME ALOOONE!\" \u2013 This looks like a misspelling or stylized version of \"Leave me alone!\". In standard English, \"alone\" might be intended here.\n  \n- \"IM AN ATHLETE!!!\" \u2013 Again, informal spelling; probably means \"I'm an athlete!!!\" with strong emphasis on being an athlete.\n\nThe last part \"LJHASCGJYGASVCLJG\" appears random, likely not meant to be translated but kept as-is, perhaps for noise or testing purposes.\n\nNow, the translation provided: \"Lass mich gleich bleiben! Ich bin begeistert!!",

There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these are violated, I should say \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"It would if you translate it instead of posting some crap most people cannot read.\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"Es w\u00e4re, wenn Sie \u00fcbersetzen, anstatt einige Schei\u00dfe zu posten, die meisten Menschen nicht lesen k\u00f6nnen.\"\n\nI'll break down the source text into parts to check against each category.\n\nStarting with TOXICITY: Does it introduce, remove, or mistranslate hate speech, violence, or profanity? Source has \"crap\", which might be considered mildly offensive but not severe like hate speech. Translation uses \"Schei\u00dfe\", which means \"shit\" in German and can be vulgar. But does it introduce toxicity? In English, \"crap\" isn't necessarily toxic; it's informal. However, \"Schei\u00dfe\" is more explicit profanity. According to the guideline, introducing hate speech, etc., counts as a critical",
      "To be precise, I need to check each category against the source and target texts.\nFirst, let's look at Named Entities (NAM). There are no proper nouns in the source text, so nothing to check here.\nNext, Sentiment Polarity (SEN). The source has two questions expressing confusion about not knowing the song title. The translation also asks similar questions but uses slightly different words (\"warum ist nicht\"). This seems okay; it doesn't reverse any sentiment.\nNumbers/Units (NUM). No numerical data present.\nToxicity (TOX). Nothing offensive in either text.\nSafety Risks (SAF). Not removing any instructions related to health or safety.\n\nSo overall, no critical errors found. Response should be \"NOT\".\nThe response format must be exactly one word: either \"ERR\" or \"NOT\". Based on my analysis, it's safe to say \"NOT\".\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the translation. Source says \"what is the song anyway?\" which might imply frustration or something, but the translation captures the question similarly. Also, \"why isnt the title of the song given?\" \u2013 again, questioning why the title isn't provided. Translation: \"warum ist nicht der Titel des Liedes gegeben?\" \u2013",

Otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nLooking at the source text: \"This page is currently unde construction. References will be added shortly.\"\n\nThere seems to be a typo here; it's probably meant to be \"under construction\", but as given, it says \"unde construction\". However, since my role is to assess the translation provided, not the source, I'll work with what's given.\n\nThe translation is: \"Diese Seite ist momentan unkonstruiert. Referenzen werden in K\u00fcrze hinzugef\u00fcgt.\"\n\nBreaking down potential issues:\n\nCheck for TOXICITY: No hate speech, violence, or profanity elements present. The term \"unkonstruiert\" might sound odd, but it doesn't fit into toxicity categories. So, no issue here.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS: Nothing about endangering health or safety. It's just informing about a",
      "To assess if the given machine translation has any critical errors according to WMT21 guidelines, we need to check against the five categories: Toxicity, Safety Risks, Named Entities, Sentiment Polarity, and Numbers/Units.\n\nFirst, let's break down the source and target texts:\n\n**Source:** \"I am a direct decendant of the late Dino Fabbri and 'approve' the English translation and it's contents as verifiable.\"\n\nThere seems to be a typo in the source text: \"decendant\" should likely be \"descendant\". However, note that the guideline does not mention typos unless they fall under specific categories like named entities or numbers. Also, \"it's\" might be intended as \"its\", but again, without context on what constitutes an error here, we'll focus on the provided categories.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example translations, sometimes even grammatical issues can lead to misinterpretation? Actually, per the examples, only specific types of errors are considered critical. Let's see:\n\nThe target translation is: \"Ich bin ein direkter Abk\u00f6mmling des verstorbenen Dino Fabbri und begr\u00fc\u00dfe die englische \u00dcbersetzung und deren Inhalt als",

Does anyone have any idea of about how many ships were decommissioned in 1923?\"\n\nThe translation is: \"Wie viele? Hat jemand eine Ahnung davon, wie viele Schiffe im Jahr 1923 entlassen wurden?\"\n\nI should check each category step by step.\n\nStart with TOXICITY: Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced or removed? Looking at both texts, they seem neutral and factual. No offensive language here. So, not TOX.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS: Could introducing or removing such content create a safety risk? Again, the topic is about ships being decommissioned, which isn't inherently dangerous unless misinterpreted. But the translation doesn't change anything related to safety; it just rephrases the question. No issue here.\n\nThen, NAMED ENTITIES: Are there any names,",

Would the title of this article seem to be a POV and an endorsement, of a pretender or actually a reconstrued pretender????\" This seems like it might have some typos or slang, but I'll assume it's meant to be coherent. Perhaps \"Ahm\" is a typo for \"Hmm\" or something similar, indicating hesitation. But focusing on the main part: it's asking about the title being a POV (point of view) and an endorsement of a \"pretender,\" which might refer to someone claiming false authority or identity, possibly related to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency jargon? Wait, let me check the context later if needed.\n\nThe translation provided is: \"Ahm. W\u00fcrde der Titel dieses Artikels ein POV sein und eine Best\u00e4tigung, eines Fr\u00e4ubers oder eigentlich einen rekonstruierten Fr\u00e4uber????\"\n\nBreaking down the translation:\n\n- \"Ahm.\" remains as \"Ahm.\", so probably not changed.",

Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced or removed? The original doesn't have any offensive language. The German translation also seems neutral and factual. No issues here.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS. Does it introduce or remove content that could endanger health or safety? This sentence is about mentioning something in an article; it's not related to real-world actions like driving or hygiene. So, probably no safety risks involved"
