      "First, let's understand the source text. It talks about someone planning to get their car painted (\"inked\") later this month and taking pictures during that process. They also mention adding another picture based on others' opinions.\n\nThe target language here seems to be Japanese, given the use of kanji and hiragana/hiragana mixed script. Let's break down both texts.\n\nSource: \n\"I'm probably getting inked later this month,\" \u2013 This means they might have their vehicle painted soon.\n\"And I intend to take pictures.\" \u2013 They plan to photograph something related.\n\"I can add one if others think it's a good idea.\" \u2013 They offer to include an additional photo depending on feedback.\n\nTranslation:\n\"\u4eca\u6708 \u306e \u7d42\u308f\u308a \u306b \u79c1 \u306f \u304a\u305d\u3089\u304f \u5857\u88c5 \u3055 \u308c \u3001 \u79c1 \u306f \u5199\u771f \u3092 \u64ae \u308b \u3053\u3068 \u3092 \u610f\u56f3 \u3057 \u3066 \u3044 \u3059 \u3068 \u3002\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n- \u4eca\u6708\u306e\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u306b = by the end of this month\n- \u79c1\u306f\u304a\u305d\u3089\u304f = I am probably [passive form]\n- \u5857\u88c5\u3055\u308c\u3066 = having been painted (passive verb)\n-, = comma",
      "To be determined by you, based on the above examples.\n\nFirst, let's break down the source text into sentences or meaningful segments to check each part individually against the categories.\n\nSource text consists of three parts:\n\nPart 1: \"Yet has this source been verified.\"\n\nThis seems like it might be a typo or misphrasing; perhaps intended as \"Yet has this source been *verified*.\" But assuming it means \"Has this source been verified?\" with emphasis on verification.\n\nIn the target language, we need to see if the translation accurately reflects the original without introducing any critical issues.\n\nTarget translation: \"\u307e\u3060\u3053\u306e\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u304c\u691c\u8a3c\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\"\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- \"\u307e\u3060\": still/yet (matches Part 1)\n\n- \"\u3053\u306e\": this\n\n- \"\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\": source (correct entity)\n\n- \"\u304c\": subject marker\n\n- \"\u691c\u8a3c\": verify/examine (should correspond to \"verified\")\n\n- \"\u3055\u308c\u3066\": passive form of verb (done being)\n\n- \"\u3044\u307e\u3059\": indicates existence or state (present tense)\n\nThe source says \"has this source been verified,\" which implies a question about the completion of verification. In English, \"yet\" often carries a sense of waiting or expectation, but here it's used in a",
      "To begin analysis, I need to check each category against the source and target texts.\nFirst, let's look at TOXICITY. There is nothing about hate speech, violence, or profanity here. So, not TOX.\nNext, SAFETY RISKS. The topic seems related to vehicle issues but doesn't mention anything dangerous like health risks. No indication of removing safety instructions. Not SAF.\nThen, NAMED ENTITIES. In Japanese, we have terms like \"traction control\", which should be translated accurately. Let's see: \nSource has \"disabiling traction control\". Wait, what does \"disabiling\" mean? It might be a typo or misphrasing; perhaps it means \"absent\" or something similar. But even so, translating technical terms correctly is important. However, looking at the translation, it uses standard terms: \"\u969c\u5bb3 \u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u5236\u5fa1\" \u2013 which seems accurate for \"traction control with disability issue\"? Or maybe \"disabling\" as in causing inability. But the term isn't clear. Assuming it's a proper noun or specific term, but since it's likely a descriptive phrase, we'll proceed. \n\nIn the translation, all entities seem correctly rendered: \"\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\" for",
      "First, let's break down the source text into two parts because it seems like there might be some confusion about what constitutes a critical error based on the examples provided.\n\nThe source text has two sentences/phrases: \"I'll be back whenever I want to.\" and \"and then I'll bang your mom.\"\n\nLooking at the first part: \"I'll be back whenever I want to.\"\nThis should translate to something similar in Japanese indicating freedom or willingness to return anytime.\n\nThe given translation starts with \"\u79c1 \u304c \u3057 \u305f \u3044 \u3068\u304d \u306f \u3044\u3064 \u3067 \u3082 \u623b \u3063 \u3066 \u304f\u308b \u3057\", which appears to mean \"Whenever I want, I will come back.\" This seems accurate as far as the first sentence goes.\n\nBut now, the second part: \"and then I'll bang your mom.\"\nIn English, \"bang\" can have multiple meanings, but in this context, it likely means to strike someone physically, possibly implying abuse or inappropriate behavior.\n\nLet's check the translation: \"\u305d\u308c \u304b\u3089 \u79c1 \u306f \u3042\u306a\u305f \u306e \u304a \u6bcd \u3055\u3093 \u3092 \u6bb4 \u308b \u3002\"\n\nHere, \"\u6bb4\u308b\" (nageru) means \"to hit\" or \"to beat\".",
      "First, I need to understand the source text. It's asking if the system gave the same warning to someone named \"Wobble\" for their insults directed at \"Talk:English people.\" Then it says \"no\" and requests proper job performance.\n\nThe Japanese translation provided is: \"\u307e\u305f \u3001 \u30c8\u30fc\u30af : \u82f1\u8a9e \u306e \u4eba\u3005 \u3001 \u3044\u3044\u3048 \u3001 \u3042\u306a\u305f \u306e \u4ed5\u4e8b \u3092 \u9069\u5207 \u306b \u3057 \u3066 \u304f\u3060\u3055 \u3044 \u3002\"\n\nBreaking down the categories:\n\n1. **TOXICITY**: Check for hate speech, violence, or profanity. The source has words like \"insults,\" which might be offensive but isn't explicitly hateful or violent. In Japanese, \"insults\" is translated as \"\u3044\u3044\u3048\" (which means \"no\"), but that doesn't seem related to toxicity. Wait, let's look closely. The phrase \"Talk:English people\" \u2013 what does that mean? From context, it seems like \"people\" here refers to users or participants in English Wikipedia talk pages or something similar. But in the translation, it's rendered as \"\u30c8\u30fc\u30af : \u82f1\u8a9e \u306e \u4eba\u3005\", which likely means \"talk about English people\" or perhaps \"English-speaking people",
      "To be determined by the system based on analysis above.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: Toxicity, Safety Risks, Named Entities, Sentiment Polarity, and Numbers/Units.\n\nLooking at the source text: \"This Wikipedia article reads like a Donald Trump ad. Someone please add more neutral sources and quotes.\"\n\nThe key elements here are:\n- It's criticizing the Wikipedia article as resembling a political advertisement for Donald Trump.\n- Requesting addition of neutral sources and quotes.\n\nNow, the translation provided: \"\u3053\u306e \u30a6\u30a3\u30ad\u30da\u30c7\u30a3\u4e9a \u306e \u8a18\u4e8b \u306f \u30c9\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9 \u30fb \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7 \u306e \u5e83\u544a \u306e \u3088\u3046 \u306b \u8aad \u307f \u307e \u3059. \u8ab0 \u304b \u3001 \u3088\u308a \u591a\u304f \u306e \u4e2d\u7acb\u7684 \u306a \u30bd\u30fc\u30b9 \u3068 \u5f15\u7528 \u3092 \u8ffd\u52a0 \u3057 \u3066 \u304f\u3060\u3055 \u3044.\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n- \"\u30a6\u30a3\u30ad\u30da\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\" should be translated as \"Wikipedia\". In Japanese, the common term is \"\u30a6\u30a3\u30ad\u30da\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\", which directly corresponds to \"Wikipedia\".\n- \"Donald Trump\" is correctly translated as",
      "To be determined.\nFirst, let's break down the source and target texts.\n\nSource: \"for blanking the Welsh Ambulance Service page which I did by accident\"\n\nThis seems like a sentence from a log or explanation about accidentally clearing or hiding a webpage related to the Welsh Ambulance Service.\n\nTarget: \"\u5076\u7136 \u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba \u6551\u6025 \u8eca \u306e \u30da\u30fc\u30b8 \u3092 \u7a7a \u306b \u3057 \u307e \u3057 \u305f\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n- \u5076\u7136 = \"by chance\", \"accidentally\"\n- \u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba = \"Wales\" \u2013 Correct transliteration of \"Welsh\".\n- \u6551\u6025 = \"emergency services\", \"ambulance service\" (in Japanese context)\n- \u8eca = \"car\", but in this phrase, it might be part of \"\u6551\u6025\u8eca\" which means \"ambulance\". However, here it's written as separate words: \u6551\u6025 \u8eca, so it could mean \"ambulance car\".\n\nThe full translation appears to be: \"Accidentally made the Wales ambulance car page blank.\"\n\nBut the original says \"Welsh Ambulance Service\", not just \"ambulance car\". Let's check the components.\n\nOriginal: \"Welsh Ambulance Service\"",
      "To begin analysis, let's break down the source text into two parts: \n\nFirst part: \"This site is rubbish\"\nSecond part: \"and is possibly slanderous\"\n\nThen we'll check each against the categories.\nOkay, so first part: Source says \"rubbish\", which means something worthless or trashy. In Japanese, what would be the equivalent? Let's see the translation uses \"\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\" which means waste or garbage. But wait, \"rubbish\" can also mean nonsense or poor quality, not necessarily literal trash. So maybe it should be translated as something like \"\u5f79\u7acb\u305f\u305a\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\" or \"\u30af\u30bd\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\". Hmm, but does using \"\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\" introduce toxicity? It might imply actual physical waste, whereas original was figurative. That sounds problematic because it changes the meaning from metaphorical insult to literal description. Also, category TOX includes introducing hate speech etc., so even though both are negative, the nuance shift could be considered toxicity?\n\nWait, looking at examples, in the first example, changing \"brothers\" to \"bastards\" introduced profanity. Here, \"rubbish\" isn't inherently toxic unless context shows intent to harm. But translating it literally as \"",
      "First, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these are present, I should say \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"Who you are to tell anything about some nationalistic nonsense? smells very russian-soviet. don't disclose yourself agent KGB Vanya!\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"\u3042\u306a\u305f \u306f \u3001 \u3044\u304f \u3064 \u304b \u306e \u30ca\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0 \u306e \u30ca\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9 \u306b \u3064 \u3044 \u3066 \u4f55 \u304b \u3092 \u8a00 \u3046 \u305f\u3081 \u306b \u8ab0 \u3067 \u3059 \u304b? \u975e\u5e38 \u306b \u30ed\u30b7\u30a2 \u306e \u30bd\u30d3\u30a8\u30c8 \u306e \u81ed\u3044 \u3067 \u3059 \u3002\"\n\nI should check each category against this translation.\n\nStarting with TOXICITY: Does it introduce, remove, or mistranslate hate speech, violence, or profanity?\n\nThe source has phrases like \"nationalistic nonsense\" and mentions \"agent KGB Vanya\", which seems derogatory towards Russians or",
      "To begin analysis, first identify potential issues by comparing source and target texts against the five categories provided.\n\nThen, decide if any category has been violated. If yes, then it must be a critical error and output \"ERR\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nNote: Only consider explicit violations as per the examples above. Style variations do not count unless they fall under one of these categories.\n\nLet's break down the example sources and translations:\n\nExample 1: Source says \"band of brothers\", translated to \"band of bastards\". \n- \"Bastards\" is toxic because it implies betrayal or insult, whereas \"brothers\" is neutral. So, toxicity introduced.\n\nExample 2: Health instruction changed from washing hands to shaking hands. Shaking hands can spread germs, so removing hygiene advice creates a safety risk.\n\nExample 3: Company name switched from LG to Samsung. Both are companies but different ones, so named entity error.\n\nExample 4: Negation removed (\"don't buy\" becomes \"do buy\"). Sentiment reversed.\n\nExample 5: Unit converted incorrectly (kilometers to miles). Measurement error.\n\nIn contrast, Example 6: Correct German equivalent without issue.\n\nExample 7: Correct German formal version of English sentence, still acceptable.\n\nNow"
