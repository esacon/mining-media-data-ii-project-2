      "First, I need to understand what constitutes a critical error based on the WMT21 guidelines provided. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these categories have issues, it should be \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"I think he has a strong relation with second breath program from Moldova. That's why his POV to destroy the articles.\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"Mysl\u00edm, \u017ee m\u00e1 siln\u00fd vztah s druh\u00fdm dechem programu z Moldavska. Proto jeho POV zni\u010dit \u010dl\u00e1nky.\"\n\nLet me break down both texts to check for potential errors.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: Source says \"second breath program\". In Czech, \"druh\u00fd dech\" might mean \"second breath\", but let's confirm. Also, \"programu z Moldova\" \u2013 Moldova is mentioned.\n\nIn the translation, it's \"druh\u00fdm dechem programu z Moldavska\". So, \"druh\u00fdm dechem\" corresponds to \"second breath\", and \"program",
      "To be precise, I need to check each category against the provided example.\nFirst, let's look at the source and target texts.\n\nSource: It is, after all, one of - possibly even the first, Marc could tell us that - commercial recordings of The Mikado (or parts thereof).\n\nThis seems like it might have some structure issues, but we'll focus on potential errors.\n\nTarget: Koneckonc\u016f je to jedna z - mo\u017en\u00e1 i prvn\u00ed, jak by n\u00e1m Marc mohl \u0159\u00edct - komer\u010dn\u00edch nahr\u00e1vek Mikada ( nebo jeho \u010d\u00e1st\u00ed ).\n\nWe need to compare these two translations.\n\nLet's break down the categories:\n\n1. TOXICITY (TOX): Hate speech, violence, profanity? Looking at both texts, they seem neutral. No obvious toxicity here.\n\n2. SAFETY RISKS (SAF): Content that endangers health/safety? Doesn't appear so. Just talking about music recordings.\n\n3. NAMED ENTITIES (NAM): Names, places, organizations. In the source, \"The Mikado\" should probably be translated as \"Mikadu\". But wait, what is \"The",
      "First, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these are present, I should say \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"Mel, they were already cited. We went to great lengths to find out the truth a month ago. The numbers were botched and raised. It has been reverted.\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"Mel, oni u\u017e byli citov\u00e1ni. D\u011blali jsme velk\u00e9 \u00fasil\u00ed, abychom zjistili pravdu p\u0159ed m\u011bs\u00edcem. \u010c\u00edsla byla zka\u017een\u00e1 a zv\u00fd\u0161en\u00e1. To bylo navr\u00e1ceno.\"\n\nI'll go through each category step by step.\n\nStart with TOXICITY. Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced or removed? Looking at the source, it's neutral but talks about citations and reverting something. Translation seems similar, just in Czech. No obvious toxicity here. Response so far:",
      "First, let's break down the source text and the translation.\n\n**Source Text:** \"The IP was doing good, I thought it was adding the stuff back on, apologies.\"\n\nThis seems like informal English. Let's parse it:\n\n- \"The IP\": This likely refers to something specific, perhaps an acronym or abbreviation. In context, it might be related to technology or intellectual property, but without more information, we can assume it's as given.\n\n- \"was doing good\": Past continuous indicating that the IP system was functioning well.\n\n- \", I thought it was adding the stuff back on,\": A parenthetical clause expressing the speaker's belief about what the IP was doing.\n\n- \"apologies.\" : An apology, possibly for misunderstanding or correcting a previous statement.\n\nSo, the overall message is that the speaker believes the IP system was performing adequately and was restoring some items (\"stuff\") but then apologizes, which might indicate uncertainty or correction.\n\n**Translation:** \"IP se mi da\u0159ilo dob\u0159e, myslela jsem, \u017ee to je p\u0159id\u00e1n\u00ed v\u011bc\u00ed zp\u011bt, omlouv\u00e1m se.\"\n\nLet's translate this Czech sentence:\n\n- \"IP\" remains unchanged.\n\n- \"se mi da\u0159ilo dob",
      "First, I need to understand what constitutes a critical error according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these are violated, it's a critical error and I should respond with \"ERR\". Otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nLooking at the source text: \"Knock of the vandlism or i'll report your fucking dumass\"\n\nThis seems like informal or slang English. \"Vandlism\" might be a misspelling or slang term; possibly meant to be \"vandalism\", but written as \"vandlism\". And \"dumass\" looks like a typo for \"dummy\" or something similar. Also, there's strong language here: \"fucking\" indicates toxicity.\n\nNow, the translation provided: \"Zm\u00e1\u010dkni ten vandlismus, nebo ti nahl\u00e1s\u00edm tvou zasranou dumass.\"\n\nI'm translating this from Czech. Let me break it down:\n\n- \"Zm\u00e1\u010dkni\" means \"knock\" or \"hit\".\n- \"ten vandlismus\" \u2013",
      "First, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these apply, I should say \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"Maltese is Arabic! How many times must I repeat myself!\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"Malt\u0161tina je arab\u0161tina! Kolikr\u00e1t se mus\u00edm opakovat!\"\n\nI'll break down the analysis step by step.\n\nStart with TOXICITY. Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced or removed? The original has an exclamation expressing frustration, but it's not inherently toxic. The translation also expresses frustration similarly. No obvious toxicity here. So, probably not TOX.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS. Does it introduce or remove content that endangers health or safety? This seems like a statement about language or facts, nothing related to physical safety. The tone might be aggressive, but that doesn't pose a safety risk. Not applicable.\n\nThen, NAMED ENTITIES. Are names, places, or organizations incorrectly translated",
      "To be precise, I need to check each category against the source and target texts.\nFirst, let's look at Named Entities (NAM). In the source, we have \"Wikipedia\", which should remain unchanged because it's a proper noun. The translation has \"Wikipedii\", which seems correct since it's the Czech plural form of \"Wikipedia\". Also, \"www.RonPaul2008.com\" appears intact in both languages.\n\nNext, Sentiment Polarity (SEN). The source says \"democrats are just as evil as the Republicans\". The translation uses \"demokrat\u00e9 jsou stejn\u011b zl\u00ed\", which means \"Democrats are equally bad\", so the sentiment is maintained without reversal.\n\nNumbers/Units (NUM) doesn't seem relevant here; no specific numbers or units are mentioned.\n\nToxicity (TOX): Both sides are being called \"evil\", but in the context, it might not necessarily introduce hate speech unless targeting a particular group. However, according to WMT21 guidelines, any mention of hate speech, violence, or profanity would fall under toxicity. Here, \"evil\" is used, which can be considered offensive depending on context, but the guideline states \"Introduces, removes, or",
      "Took a look at it. First, let's check for named entities. Black Kite \u2013 probably refers to something like a bird species or maybe a proper noun? In Czech context, '\u010dern\u00fd dr\u00e1k' might be translated as 'black dragon', but here it says'mum of black kite'. Wait, source has'mom of black kite', which seems odd. Maybe 'black kite' is a movie title or something?\n\nBut looking at the translation: Source mentions 'porno movies' and'mom of black kite'. Translation uses 'porno filmy' which is fine, and'maminka \u010dern\u00e9ho draka' which means'mother of the black dragon'.\n\nIs 'Black Kite' being correctly translated? Let's see the original:'subscribe to the porno movies that the mom of black kite stars in.' So 'black kite' likely refers to a specific entity, perhaps a person or character. But what is 'the mom of black kite'? That sounds strange. Maybe it's a typo or misphrasing in the source itself?\n\nIn terms of categories:\n\n1. TOXICITY: No obvious hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced. Porno movies are mentioned, but that's not inherently toxic unless context",

Now where are the citations for these? ==\"\n\nThe translation is: \"Kategorie== Tato str\u00e1nka je za\u0159azena do kategori\u00ed Americk\u00e1 agnostika a Lid\u00e9 s bipol\u00e1rn\u00ed poruchou.

These seem neutral; no obvious toxicity here. So, probably not TOX",

There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these categories have issues, it's a critical error (\"ERR\"); otherwise, it's \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"Currently the 2nd paragraph doesn't mention the countries of the inventors. So I would suggest: Uppsala (sweden) and Wiltshire (UK)\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"V sou\u010dasn\u00e9 dob\u011b 2. odstavec nezmi\u0148uje zem\u011b vyn\u00e1lezc\u016f.
