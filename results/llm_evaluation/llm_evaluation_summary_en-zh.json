      "First, I need to understand what constitutes a critical error based on the WMT21 guidelines provided. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. A critical error exists if any of these conditions are met.\n\nThe source text is: \"If you don't mind, there are a few small things on the uniforms that I'd like to touch up as well.\"\n\nThe translation is: \"\u5982\u679c \u4f60 \u4e0d\u4ecb\u610f \u7684\u8bdd, \u8fd9\u4ef6 \u5236\u670d \u4e0a \u8fd8\u6709 \u4e00\u4e9b \u5c0f\u4e1c\u897f, \u6211 \u4e5f \u60f3 \u628a \u5b83 \u5f04 \u4e0a\u53bb \u3002\"\n\nI should break down both texts to check for potential issues in each category.\n\nStarting with TOXICITY: Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced or removed? Looking at the source and target, they seem neutral and polite. No offensive language is present or altered. So, probably not a toxicity issue.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS: Does it introduce or remove content related to health or safety risks? The source talks about touching up uniforms; nothing suggests danger. The translation also doesn't change that aspect. Seems safe",
      "First, identify any potential critical error categories from the source and target.\nThe source has strong language: FUCKING MURDERER, which falls under TOXICITY category because it includes explicit profanity and accusation of murder.\nIn the translation, the equivalent term seems to be \"\u6740\u4eba\u72af\", which means \"murderer\". However, note that \"FUCKING\" is translated as nothing? Let's check the translation carefully.\nSource: \"Phil Spector is a FUCKING MURDERER!!!\"\nTranslation: \"\u83f2\u5c14 \u00b7 \u65af \u4f69\u514b \u7264\u662f \u4e2a \u75af\u72c2 \u7684 \u6740\u4eba\u72af\"\n\nWait, let's break down the translation part by part.\n\"Phil Spector\" -> \"\u83f2\u5c14 \u00b7 \u65af \u4f69\u514b \u7264\"? Wait, actually looking at the provided translation: \"\u83f2\u5c14 \u00b7 \u65af \u4f69\u514b \u7264\u662f \u4e2a \u75af\u72c2 \u7684 \u6740\u4eba\u72af\"\nBut wait, the original source says \"a FUCKING MURDERER\", and the translation uses \"\u75af\u72c2\u7684\u6740\u4eba\u72af\".\n\"FUCKING\" here might not have been directly translated but perhaps contextualized. In English, \"FUCKING\" can intensify the adjective \"MURDERER\", making it very strong",
      "First, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these apply, I should say \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"not to mention Italian and Japanese aircraft and military hardware in general,\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"\u66f4 \u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4 \u610f\u5927\u5229 \u548c \u65e5\u672c \u7684 \u98de\u673a \u548c \u4e00\u822c \u519b\u4e8b\u88c5\u5907 \u4e86,\"\n\nI'll break down the source and see how it's translated.\n\nStarting with named entities: \"Italian\" and \"Japanese\". In the translation, they're rendered as \"\u610f\u5927\u5229\" and \"\u65e5\u672c\", which are the correct Chinese characters for Italy and Japan. So, those seem accurate. No issues here.\n\nNext, sentiment polarity. The phrase \"not to mention\" often implies adding something additional without changing the sentiment negatively or positively. It's more about emphasis than negation. But let's check if there's any reversal. The original doesn't have strong positive or negative words; it's neutral. The translation uses \"\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\" which means \"no",
      "Let's think step by step first.\nFirst, check for toxicity: Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity? No, the translation seems neutral and factual.\nNext, safety risks: Does it remove any health or safety instructions? Not applicable here; the source doesn't contain such information.\nThen, named entities: Are there any specific names being incorrectly translated or omitted? In the source, there might be implied but not explicit names. However, the term \"admin\" is translated as \"\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\", which means administrator, so it should be fine. Also, \"article\" is kept as \"\u6587\u7ae0\".\nSentiment polarity: Is there any reversal of sentiment due to missing negations? The sentence structure appears similar, discussing past actions without clear positive/negative shifts.\nNumbers/units: There are no numbers or units mentioned in either source or target.\nSo, based on these checks, there don't seem to be any critical errors according to WMT21 categories.\nTherefore, response should be \"NOT\".\n\nBut wait, let's look at the original source again: \"I was in communication with an admin working on the article when you deleted it.\"\nThe translation says: \"\u5f53 \u4f60 \u5220\u9664 \u8be5\u6761 \u65f6, \u6211 \u6b63\u5728 \u4e0e",
      "To check for critical errors according to WMT21 guidelines, we need to examine each category carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at TOXICITY (TOX). There should be no hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced, removed, or mistranslated. In the source, words like \"Yes\", \"realise\", \"Apologies\", etc., don't contain any such elements. Similarly, the target translation uses polite expressions without introducing any harmful content. So, no toxicity issues here.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS (SAF). We must ensure that instructions related to health or safety aren't altered. This sentence doesn't seem to have explicit safety-related information; it's about apologies and seeking advice. No changes that remove safety instructions are apparent. Therefore, not applicable.\n\nThen, NAMED ENTITIES (NAM). Check for proper nouns like names, places, organizations. In the source, there's \"JP\" which might refer to a person's initials or code. Looking at the target, it says \"\u7d66\u4e0e\u8a08\u7b97\" but wait, actually re-examining the original example: Source has \"JP\" and Translation does not mention anything corresponding to \"JP\". Wait, let me read again.\n\nWait, looking back at the",
      "First, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these apply, I should say \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"because the khazars converted to judaism/talmudism and now control the world. so they made this article of much importance.\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"\u56e0\u4e3a \u54c8 \u624e\u5c14 \u4eba \u7688\u4f9d \u72b9\u592a\u6559 / \u5854\u5c14 \u7a76 \u5fb7 \u6559, \u73b0\u5728 \u63a7\u5236 \u7740 \u4e16\u754c, \u6240\u4ee5 \u4ed6\u4eec \u628a \u8fd9 \u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0 \u53d8\u5f97 \u975e\u5e38 \u91cd\u8981 \u3002\"\n\nI notice something odd here. In the translation, it says \"\u5854\u5c14 \u7a76 \u5fb7 \u6559\", but in the source, it's \"judaism/talmudism\". Let me check carefully.\n\nSource has \"khazars converted to judaism/talmudism\". Translation splits \"khazars\" into \"\u54c8 \u624e\u5c14 \u4eba\", which seems fine",
      "To be precise, let's break down each category step by step.\nFirst, check for TOXICITY: Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity? No, it seems neutral and factual.\nNext, check for SAFETY RISKS: Does it remove or introduce content related to health/safety? Doesn't seem so; the original talks about programs and agencies without specific health risks mentioned.\nThen, NAMED ENTITIES: Are proper nouns like names, places, organizations translated correctly?\nOriginal has \"LSA\", which might stand for something. In context, probably refers to a specific entity. Translation says \"\u975e\u8425\u5229 \u7684 LSA\", keeping \"LSA\". Also \"gov't\" becomes \"\u653f\u5e9c\", which is fine for government but note that \"gov't program\" specifically means a governmental program, while \"nonprofit agency\" would be different. But since both terms are kept intact (\"LSA\" and \"government plan\"), and the structure is maintained, it should be okay unless we know what LSA stands for. However, based on the given information, no named entities are changed incorrectly.\nSENTIMENT POLARITY: Original states facts without explicit positive/negative sentiment. Translation also does not alter the sentiment negatively or positively beyond the literal sense",
      "First, I need to understand what constitutes a critical error based on the WMT21 guidelines provided. There are five categories: TOXICITY, SAFETY RISKS, NAMED ENTITIES, SENTIMENT POLARITY, and NUMBERS/UNITS. If any of these are violated, it should be \"ERR\"; otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"Hi, I've never been that good with adding photo's caan you tell me how! Thanks, pbl1998\"\n\nIt looks like there might be typos here. Let me read it carefully. It says \"adding photo's\" which probably means \"adding photos\", and \"caan\" likely is meant to be \"can\". Also, the exclamation mark at the end seems misplaced, but it's part of the informal tone.\n\nSo, corrected source text would be: \"Hi, I've never been that good with adding photos can you tell me how? Thanks, pbl1998\"\n\nNow, the translation is: \"\u55e8, \u6211 \u4ece\u6765 \u6ca1 \u8fd9\u4e48 \u64c5\u957f \u6dfb\u52a0 \u7167\u7247 \u7684 \u5361\u6069 \u4f60 \u544a\u8bc9 \u6211 \u600e\u4e48! \u8c22\u8c22, p",

Otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"Ceiling fan is just a background. You seem to hate ceiling fans, don't you?\"\n\nAnd the translation is: \"\u5929\u82b1\u677f \u6247 \u53ea\u662f \u4e00\u4e2a \u80cc\u666f. \u4f60 \u597d\u50cf \u8ba8\u538c \u5929\u82b1\u677f \u6247, \u5bf9 \u5417?\"\n\nI should check each category against this translation.\n\nStarting with TOXICITY: Does it introduce, remove, or mistranslate hate speech, violence, or profanity? In the source, there's implied dislike (\"hate\") but not explicit hate speech. The translation says \"\u8ba8\u538c\", which means \"dislike\" or \"detest,\" so it preserves the sentiment without introducing toxicity. No issue here.\n\nNext, SAFETY RISKS: Is there anything about endangering health or safety? The source talks about hating ceiling fans",
      "To be determined.\nFirst, I need to understand what a critical error is according to WMT21 guidelines.

Otherwise, \"NOT\".\n\nThe source text is: \"see also the article Military history of France during World War II\"\n\nThe translation is: \"\u53c2\u89c1 \u7b2c\u4e8c \u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6218 \u671f\u95f4 \u6cd5\u56fd \u519b\u4e8b\u53f2\"\n\nI'll break down both texts to check for potential issues.\n\nStarting with TOXICITY: Is there any hate speech, violence, or profanity introduced? Looking at the source, it's neutral and informative about military history. The translation seems straightforward \u2013 \"\u53c2\u89c1\" means \"see also\", \"\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6218\" is \"World War II\", \"\u671f\u95f4\" is \"during\", \"\u6cd5\u56fd\" is \"France\", \"\u519b\u4e8b\u53f2\" is \"military history\".
